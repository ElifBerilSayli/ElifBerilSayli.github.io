                            <p class="mb-4">2022 is the most innovative year for me. There were a lot of memories and numerous things for the first time in my life.  
                                Each season, I collected a lot of memories. I am so happy to include my life's regular sport this year
                                My Christmas gift which was a board game carried a clue about January and the rest of the year. Throughout the year, I was a board game addict and my favorites are Catan and Entrika for now. I have a board game team for the next years.
                                February starts with a skiing adventure at Erciyes. To be honest, I fell a thousand times and there was a lot of effort to succeed but sledding is convenient for easy fun. Snowfall and landscape were amazing at the mountain.
                                Spring starts with a lot of picnics and volleyball activities. 
                                With the Spanish wind, I watched the Flamenco show.  Also, Bilkent Symphony Orchestra had a great performance of movie music.
                                The summer has a lot of swimming experience at Ayvalik and Bodrum. On the other hand, my best experience of summer was scuba diving. I got an open diver certificate and I saw amazing underwater creatures. To reach the waterfall, I was trekking for a long path.
                                Autumn starts with a driving learning journey. This journey seems to continue next year. Also, I attended beginner lindy-hop classes. The ceramic mug workshop and polygon added color to my fall.

                            <p class="mb-4">For 2023, I have a dream journey to Italy. Also, I want to continue scuba diving and see lots of underwater creatures. Snowboarding can be nice. I am open to all surprises from 2023.</p>
